This is a To-Do list made for TibiaXBot. Everything that is on here
is stuff that we will add or are adding, or maybe already added.

What you see here is nothing you should even care about, because 
only the programmers should.

If you want to become a programmer for TibiaXBot, please write to 
Jesper_Kladden or Aluwama. It would be the best if you wrote to us both,
because we wont add you to the team without both have been talking about it.
